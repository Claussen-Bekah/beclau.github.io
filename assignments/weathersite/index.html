                    <div class="article-item">

                        <p>We ranchers pride ourselves on adapting. No matter what, no matter the weather, no matter our health, we need to be out and with our livestock. Our livestock means everything to us. Fortunately, we also have a big network of friends, family, and neighbors who are willing to pitch in when we need it. One such neighbor is Mark McCallum of Fish Haven. McCallum is one of the best and busiest ranchers around and most of you probably know him. In spite of his busy schedule and large herd, Mark is always willing to step out and help a neighbor in need.
                        </p>
                        <p>At the end of March, Fish Haven experienced a terrible storm. With massive gusts and sheets of rain, it was hard to walk outside to get the garbage can, let alone be in the pasture herding cows. Thanks to Gem State Weather, Mark was able to track the storm's progress and saw that it was going to affect his neighbor's cows, who he could see didn't have adequate shelter. Mark's neighbors were stuck in Logan after heading down for what was supposed to be a quick trip, but weren't able to come back up because of the sudden storm.</p>
